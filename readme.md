This addon is a Wordpress XML import tool to transfer your Wordpress content to Statamic. Just export an xml from Wordpress and import it. This addon is intended as a starting point for a new site, so it will overwrite similar content (except for existing users).

* It adds new authors as new users.
* It adds post thumbnails.
* It adds meta keys and values so you keep your ACF info.
* It adds categories as new terms.
* It adds post types as new collections and adds posts as entries to that collection.
* It adds pages.
* And it downloads all attachments and saves them the assets folder.

Importing may take a while for big export files. After importing you should search and replace to fine tune everything.
